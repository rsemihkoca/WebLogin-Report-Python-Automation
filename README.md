# WebLogin-Report-Python-Automation
The goal in this report is to analyze the **login performance of a website** based on location.

Data manipulation and pivoting processes, which were done manually in 20-25 minutes over Excel, were automated for each report with Python(pandas,numpy,tkinter), and the entire report was output in an average of 5 minutes.

*Although the program was used on real data, the uploaded output file was taken from the previously created database due to the personal data protection law.

*Column names, cluster names and sheet names translated to English from Turkish for better understanding.
